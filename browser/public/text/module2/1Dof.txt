The first important concept to learn is the one I just messed up: orientation. As you saw, my hand can't grab the object like this. But...
...if I change the orientation of my hand, I can pick up this object.
Now you try. I have moved my hand over Box 2. Can you rotate my wrist so I can pick up Box 2? When you're ready for me to pick up the box, press any button on the box.
Alright. Let's see
Great! I was able to determine if I succesfully picked up the box by comparing the force my motors exert on my joints to maintain my position before and after closing the gripper.
Oops, I couldnâ€™t pick it up like that. This time, try to get the entire width of the box in my grasp.
You just helped me change my gripper's orientation so that I could pick up the box. Now, help me pick up Box 3. This time, my gripper is already in the correct orientation, but not in the correct position. Can you move my hand so that it can pick up Box 3? When you're ready for me to pick up the box, press any button on the box.
Great! Before, you helped me change my gripper's orientation so that I could pick up Box 2. This time, you helped me change my gripper's position so that I could pick up Box 3.
Now, help me pick up Box 4. If you press the red button on the side of the box, you can change my arm's position. If you press the green button on the box, you can change my arm's orientation. Feel free to switch between the two modes to figure out the difference between the position and orientation. When you're ready for me to pick up Box 4, press any button on the top of the box.
Great job!
